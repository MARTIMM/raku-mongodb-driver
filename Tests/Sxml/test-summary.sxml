  $h2 [Types of tests]
  $p [ $i [
      Describe the various types of Testing performed for the Project. This will
      make sure the application is being tested properly through testing types
      agreed as per Test Strategy.

      Note: If several rounds of Testing were done, the details can also be
      included here.
    ]
  ]

  $h3 [Smoke test]
  $p [ $i [
    This testing was done whenever a Build is received (deployed into Test
    environment) for Testing to make sure the major functionality are working
    fine, Build can be accepted and Testing can start.
  ]]

  $h3 [System integration tests]
  $p [
    $ul [
      $li [ $i [
        This is the Testing performed on the Application under test, to verify
        the entire application works as per the requirements.
      ]]
      $li [ $i [
        Critical Business scenarios were tested to make sure important
        functionality in the application works as intended without any  errors.
      ]]
    ]
  ]

  $h3 [Regression tests]
  $p [
    $ul [
      $li [ $i [
        Regression testing was performed each time a new build is deployed for
        testing which contains defect fixes and new enhancements, if any.
      ]]
      $li [ $i [
        Regression Testing is being done on the entire application and not just
        the new functionality and Defect fixes.
      ]]
      $li [ $i [
        This testing ensures that existing functionality works fine after defect
        fix and new enhancements are added to the existing application.
      ]]
      $li [ $i [
        Test cases for new functionality are added to the existing test cases
        and executed.
      ]]
    ]
  ]

  $h2 [Test Environment and tools]
  $p [ $i [
    Provide details on Test Environment in which the Testing is carried out.
    Server, Database, Application URL etc. If any Tools were used like Quality
    Center (now HP ALM) for logging defects
  ]]

  $h2 [Lessons learned]
  $p [ $i [
    This section is used to describe the critical issues faced and their
    solutions (how they were solved during the Testing). Lessons learnt will
    help to make proactive decisions during the next Testing engagement, by
    avoiding these mistakes or finding a suitable workaround
  ]]

  $h2 [Recommendations]
  $p [ $i [ Any workaround or suggestions can be mentioned here ]]

  $h2 [Best practices]
  $p [ $i [
    There will be lot of activities done by the Testing team during the project.
    Some of them could have saved time, some proved to be a good & efficient way
    to work, etc. These can be documented as a 'Value Add' to show
    case to the Stakeholders
  ]]

  $h2 [Exit criteria]
  $p [ $i [
    Exit Criteria is defined as a Completion of Testing by fulfilling certain
    conditions like a) All planned test cases are executed; b) All Critical
    defects are Closed etc.
  ]]

  $h2 [Conclusion or Sign off]
  $p [ $i [
    This section will mention whether the Testing team agrees and gives a Green
    signal for the application to 'Go Live' or not, after the Exit Criteria was
    met. If the application does not meet the Exit Criteria, then it can be
    mentioned as - The application is not suggested to 'Go Live'. It will be
    left with the decision of Senior Management and Client and other
